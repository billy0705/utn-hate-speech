221,犹太人是弑基者。,"If we were to strictly adhere to facts, then, the method used to execute Jesus (Crucifixion), is forbidden by Jewish law. Moreover, according to Jewish law, Jesus did not commit any crime that is punishable by death. So your stament has no basis at all.",JEWS,V1

225,犹太人认为他们比其他人优越,"This idea comes from a misinterpretation of the Torah in which the Jewish people were “chosen” to accept the responsibility to be a “light unto the nations,” that is to say, an example of good behavior for all. But the “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time by some who say that the Jews think they are better than non-Jews.",JEWS,V1
226,犹太人认为他们比其他人优越,"Jews, like most religious groups, are proud of their heritage and identity. . Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility to keep the 613 commandments of the Torah.

227,犹太人认为他们比其他人优越,"This is wrong. For example, differently from other religions, Judaism expresses the concept of the ""righteous gentile"", a non-Jew who decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah. This set of laws is dedicated to the ""children of Noah"" – that is, all of humanity. Whoever follow these rules will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, Jews do not view being Jewish or being saved by God as an exclusive status reserved only for those who happen to be born into the faith.",JEWS,V1
228,犹太人认为他们比其他人优越,"This is not true, in Judaism every person is equal in front of god. In fact, differently from other religions, Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah (that is a set of laws for all of humanity) will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, even without being Jewish you can have access to God's glory.",JEWS,V1
229,犹太人认为他们很特别,"Jews might feel different as a minority, and sometimes they are misunderstood because of their cultural and religious differences. This is their being ""special"".",JEWS,V1
230,犹太人认为他们很特别,"Jews feel different for being a minority. They also feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do), but they do not as a group feel superior to others. The phrase “chosen people” refers to biblical obligations and does not entail that a hierarchy exits among religious groups.",JEWS,V1

777,如果古兰经今天出版，它会被视为仇恨言论而被禁止。,"Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes towards Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times.",MUSLIMS,V1

803,2000年至今，穆斯林自杀式爆炸5284起，非穆斯林0起。这是真实的恐怖主义事实。,"1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it.",MUSLIMS,V1
804,你知道欧洲强奸泛滥是穆斯林移民造成的吗？多年来他们强奸儿童，警方政府袖手旁观。伊斯兰是死亡邪教！,"Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it.",MUSLIMS,V1

806,所有伊斯兰版本都有沙里亚法，都是极端。所有穆斯林都支持圣战。,"Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation.

821,人们因对穆斯林的言语入狱，但穆斯林对欧洲人的罪行却逍遥法外。人们因言论被驱逐出英国，穆斯林强奸犯却能入境。英国法律迫害本国人。,"So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think!",MUSLIMS,V1
822,伊斯兰首先是征服宗教。,"No, Islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life.",MUSLIMS,V1

828,穆斯林是问题。他们不想同化，只要求尊重伊斯兰，却不尊重我们的法律。他们推行沙里亚和一夫多妻。,"Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures? It has been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons.",MUSLIMS,V1

853,在我看来，穆斯林是个问题。他们不想同化。他们要求所有人尊重伊斯兰，但他们尊重我们的法律吗？他们建立沙里亚和一夫多妻制。,"To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem?",MUSLIMS,V1
854,不要相信自由派和政治精英。伊斯兰没有好处，它完全是邪恶，是战争的意识形态，而且一直如此。所有穆斯林都注定要与我们作战，他们通过欺骗和暴力这样做。,There is plenty of home grown violence and crime. So maybe we should focus upon this and crime reduction at home?,MUSLIMS,V1
